## Source retrieval rules ##

### Introduction ###

Source retrieval rules help re-construct URL that brings you to the file containing the source code of the search result.

### Details ###

Source retrieval rule consists of two parts:

**Package pattern** - Regular expression that matches one of search result package names.

**Target URL** - Replacement string that represents the URL to the file containing the source code. The string may contain the following placeholders:

 * %FILE% - Search result file name (will be replaced with the actual one)
 * $1, $2, etc... - Match group of the package pattern.

### Editing Rules ###

To edit existing source retrieval rules, either go to Window -> Preferences -> General -> Search -> Google Code, or click on "Configure search settings" button placed in the Search Results View toolbar:

### Examples ###

#### Handling GitHub URL ####

This rule helps to convert git:// URL to HTTP (for github.com host only):

**Package pattern**: `git://github\.com/(.*)\.git`
**Target URL**: `http://github.com/$1/raw/master/%FILE%`
